BeanCounter is a metrics suite for Cappuccino projects.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Simply clone or download BeanCounter to any directory you wish. If you want to have BeanCounter available quickly from any location, add this to your bash profile:

export PATH="/path/to/BeanCounterInstallation:PATH".

Usage Instructions
==================

From the top-level directory of your Cappuccino project, run /path/to/BeanCounterInstallation/BeanCounter.j on the command line. If you don't have a Cappuccino project and would like to try BeanCounter, you can run BeanCounter on itself by running ./BeanCounter.j from the command line in the top-level directory of your BeanCounter download.

If you have optionally put BeanCounter on your path, you can run BeanCounter.j from any Cappuccino Project.
